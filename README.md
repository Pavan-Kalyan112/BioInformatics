# üß¨ Sequence Alignment in Bioinformatics
 ### üîπ Pairwise Sequence Alignment (PSA)
PSA compares two biological sequences (DNA, RNA, or protein) to identify regions of similarity. These similarities may indicate:

Functional or structural relationships

Evolutionary conservation

Types of PSA:

Global alignment: aligns sequences from end to end (e.g., Needleman-Wunsch algorithm)

Local alignment: aligns the most similar subregions (e.g., Smith-Waterman algorithm)

## üîß Use cases:

Comparing a query sequence with a reference

Scoring similarity using substitution matrices (e.g., BLOSUM, PAM)
# Multiple Sequence Alignment (MSA)
MSA aligns three or more sequences simultaneously to identify conserved regions across all sequences. These conserved motifs may highlight:

Evolutionarily important residues

Functional domains in proteins or genes

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools like Clustal Omega, MUSCLE, or MAFFT automate MSA.

Why MSA is important:

Builds phylogenetic trees

Identifies consensus sequences

Used in structure prediction and motif discovery

Helps generate custom substitution matrices based on real data
